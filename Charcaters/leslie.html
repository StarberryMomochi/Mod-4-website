            Leslie Abbington was taken in by the Madam a long time ago, he helped raise all her decendants so his exact
            age is unknown, all anyone knowns is that hes the only one who knew who the Madams lover was, which makes
            him a rather trustworthy man to the family, once Hazels mother died he took on the role for emotionally
            caring for Hazel which is why hazel isnt too broken.
